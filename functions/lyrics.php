	When it rains five days and the skies turn dark as night
	Then trouble's takin' place in the lowlands at night

	I woke up this mornin', can't even get out of my door
	I woke up this mornin', can't even get out of my door
	There's been enough trouble to make a poor girl wonder
	where she want to go

	Then they rowed a little boat about five miles 'cross the pond
	Then they rowed a little boat about five miles 'cross the pond
	I packed all my clothes, throwed them in and they rowed me along

	When it thunders and lightnin' and when the wind begins to blow

	When it thunders and lightnin' and the wind begins to blow
	There's thousands of people ain't got no place to go

	Then I went and stood upon some high old lonesome hill
	Then I went and stood upon some high old lonesome hill
	Then looked down on the house were I used to live

	Backwater blues done call me to pack my things and go
	Backwater blues done call me to pack my things and go
	'Cause my house fell down and I can't live there no more

	Mmm, I can't move no more
	Mmm, I can't move no more
	There ain't no place for a poor old girl to go

Down in Atlanta, ga, under the viaduct ev'ry day, drinking corn and
	Hollerin' hooray
	Pianos playing till the break of day
	But as I turned my head, I loudly said, Preach 'em blues, sing them blues
	They certainly sound good to me
	I've been in love for the last six months and ain't done worrying yet
	Moan'em blues, holler them blues
	Let me convert your soul
	'Cause just a little spirit of the blues tonight
	Let me tell you, girls, that your man ain't treating you right
	Let me tell you I don't mean no wrong
	I will learn you something if you listen to this song

	I ain't here to try to save your soul, just want to teach you how to save
	Your good jelly roll

	Going on down the line a little further now
	There's many a poor woman down
	Read on down to chapter nine,
	Woman must learn how to take their time
	Read on down to chapter ten,
	Taking other women's men, you are doing a sin
	Sing'em, sing'em, sing them blues
	Let me convert your soul
	Now one sister by the name of Sister Green
	Jumped up and done a shimmy you ain't never seen
	Sing'em, sing'em, sing them blues
	Let me convert your soul

Sisters and brothers, we met here on some serious business!

	To original hot brimstone!
	Let's you start right in to moan.

	You better get down on your knees (mmm-mmm)
	And let the good Lord hear your pleas, (oh yes!)
	Or else you want to rest with ease,

Don't know what come over me,
	Done lost my self control;
	He's the sugar in my tea,
	The jelly in my roll!

	Got me goin',
	He's got me goin',
	But I don't know where I'm headed for!

	Gee, I've got a lovin' man,
	One o' them handsome brutes,
	He's built 'ccordin' to that plan,
	Too bad when it suits.

	Got me goin',
	He's got me goin',
	But I don't know where I'm headed for!

	I can't sleep a doggone wink
	Unless he's by my side;
	Mind's so different I just can't think
	Without my easy ride!

	Got me goin',
	He's got me goin',
	But I don't know where I'm headed for!

	Lay and listen to the clock,
	Ticks loud as a drum,
	Hear the crowing of a cock,
	Still my man ain't come!

	Got me goin',
	He's got me goin',
	But I don't know where I'm headed for!

	Wouldn't be no two-time gal,
	Just one man's enough,
	I don't need no two men 'cause
	My one man knows his stuff!

	Got me goin',
	He's got me goin',
	But I don't know where I'm headed for!

	Got a heart for just one man,
	Knows how to get to it,
	For he's got the only key
	That's the perfect fit!

	Got me goin',
	He's got me goin',
	But I don't know where I'm headed for!

	'Fraid to advertise my man,
	Simply scared to death!
	These gals will hear 'bout him,
	And tryin' for they self.

	Got me goin',
	He's got me goin',
	But I don't know where I'm headed for!

Had a dream last night
	That I was dead
	Had a dream last night
	That I was dead

	Evil spirits
	All around my bed

	The devil came
	And grabbed my hand
	The devil came
	And grabbed my hand

	Took me way down
	To that red hot land

	Mean blues spirits
	Stuck their forks in me
	Mean blues spirits
	Stuck their forks in me

	Made me moan
	And groan in misery

	Fairies and dragons
	Spitting out blue flames
	Fairies and dragons
	Spitting out blue flames

	Showing their teeth
	For they was glad I came

	Demons with their eyelash
	Dripping blood
	Demons with their eyelash
	Dripping blood

	Dragging sinners
	To their brimstone flood

	This is hell, I cried
	Cried with all my might
	This is hell, I cried
	Cried with all my might

	Oh, my soul
	I can't bear the sight

	Started running
	'Cause it is my cup
	Started running
	'Cause it is my cup

	Run so fast
	Till someone woke me up

Have you ever seen a church begin to rock?
	Heard a sundown deacon preachin' to his flock?
	Have you ever seen old Satan on the run?
	Then follow me, see just how it's done, and have you;

	Ever heard a sermon stir your soul?
	Make you crave the River Jordan as you go?
	Have you ever felt as though you'd like to shout?
	Then come on and let them feelin's out, oh Lord!

	Just hear those sisters groanin'
	And hear those brothers moanin'
	Rippin' and antonin'
	On revival day

	They talkin' to a spirit
	Just like you see and hear it;
	They're sinful and they fear it
	On revival day

	When that congregation starts to sing
	Nothin' in this world don't mean a thing!

	Oh, glory hallelujah!
	Makes you feel so peculiar
	The Devil cannot rule ya
	On revival day!

	Glory glory
	Hymns are purifyin'
	Glory glory
	Wash my sins away!
	Lawdy lawdy
	Heal just like a lion
	Lawdy lawdy
	It's reborn today!

	Oh, just tell those sisters groanin'
	And hear them brothers moanin'
	Rippin' and anantonin'
	On revival day

	Oh, they're talkin' to a spirit
	Just like you see and hear it;
	They sinful and they fear it
	On revival day

	When that congregation starts to sing
	Nothin' in this world don't mean a thing!

	Oh, glory hallelujah!
	Makes you feel so peculiar
	The Devil cannot rule ya
	On revival day!

Know a fool that blows a horn
	He came from way down south
	I ain't heard such blowin' since I was born
	When that trombone's in his mouth!

	He wails and moans
	He grunts and groans
	He moans just like a cow!
	Nobody else can do his stuff
	For he won't teach them how!

	Oh Cholly, blow that thing
	That slide trombone;
	Make it talk, make it sing
	Lawdy, where did you get that tone?
	If Gabriel knows how you could blow
	He'll let you lead his band, I know!
	Oh Cholly, blow that thing
	Play that slide trombone

	Oh Cholly, make it sing
	That slide trombone
	You'll even make a king
	Get down off his throne;
	And he would breaka leg, I know
	A-doin' the charleston while you blow!
	Oh Cholly Green, play that thing
	I mean that slide trombone!

Judge you want to hear my plea
	Before you open up your court
	But I don't want no sympathy
	'Cause I done cut my good man's throat
	I caught him with a trifling Jane
	I warned him 'bout before
	I had my knife and went insane
	And the rest you ought to know
	Judge, judge, please mister judge,
	Send me to the 'lectric chair
	Judge, judge, good mister judge,
	Let me go away from here
	I want to take a journey
	To the devil down below
	I done killed my man
	I want to reap just what I sow
	Oh judge, judge, lordy lordy judge
	Send me to the 'lectric chair
	Judge, judge, hear me judge
	Send me to the 'lectric chair
	I love him so dear
	I cut him with my barlow (?)
	I kicked him in the side
	I stood here laughing o'er him
	While he wallowed around and died
	Oh judge, judge, lordy judge
	Send me to the 'lectric chair
	Judge, judge, sweet mister judge
	Send me to the 'lectric chair
	Judge, judge, good kind judge
	Burn me 'cause I don't care
	I don't want no one good mayor
	To go my bail
	I don't want to spend no
	Ninety-nine years in jail
	So judge, judge, good kind judge
	Send me to the 'lectric chair

It's a long old road, but I'm gonna find the end,
	It's a long old road, but I'm gonna find the end,
	And when I get there, I'm gonna shake hands with a friend.

	On the side of the road,I sat underneath a tree,
	On the side of the road,I sat underneath a tree,
	Nobody knows a thought that came over me.

	Weepin' and cryin', tears fallin'on the ground,
	Weepin' and cryin', tears fallin'on the ground,
	When I got to the end, I was so worried down.

	Picked up my bag, baby, and I tried again,
	Picked up my bag, baby, and I tried again,
	I got to make it, I've got to find the end!

	You can't trust nobody, you might as well be alone,
	You can't trust nobody, you might as well be alone,
	Found my long lost friend, and I might as well stayed at home!

	Captain, tell your men to get on board
	I sure see 'em just pull into another shore

	I'm dreary in mind and I'm so worried in heart
	Oh, the best of friends sho' has got to part

	Blow your whistle captain, so your men'll know what to do
	Blow your whistle captain, so your men'll know what to do
	When a woman gets dreary, ain't no tellin' what she won't do

	It's cloudy outdoors as can be
	Oh, it's cloudy as can be
	That's the time I need my good man with me

	It's rainin' and it's stormin' on the sea
	It's rainin', it's stormin' on the sea
	I feel like somebody has shipwrecked poor me
----

	I woke up this morning with a awful aching head
	I woke up this morning with a awful aching head
	My new man had left me, just a room and a empty bed

	Bought me a coffee grinder that's the best one I could find
	Bought me a coffee grinder that's the best one I could find
	Oh he could grind my coffee, cause he had a brand new grind

	He's a deep sea diver with a stroke that can't go wrong
	He's a deep sea diver with a stroke that can't go wrong
	He can stay at the bottom and his wind holds out so long

	He knows how to thrill me and he thrills me night and day
	Oh he knows how to thrill me, he thrills me night and day
	He's got a new way of loving, almost takes my breath away

	Lord he's got that sweet somethin' and I told my girlfriend Lou
	He's got that sweet somethin' and I told my girlfriend Lou
	From the way she's raving, she must have gone and tried it too

	(Part 2:)
	When my bed get empty make me feel awful mean and blue
	When my bed get empty make me feel awful mean and blue
	My springs are getting rusty, sleeping single like I do

	Bought him a blanket, pillow for his head at night
	Bought him a blanket, pillow for his head at night
	Then I bought him a mattress so he could lay just right

	He came home one evening with his beret way up high
	He came home one evening with his beret way up high
	What he had to give me, make me wring my hands and cry

	He give me a lesson that I never had before
	He give me a lesson that I never had before
	When he got to teachin' me, from my elbow down was sore

	He poured my first cabbage and he made it awful hot
	He poured my first cabbage and he made it awful hot
	When he put in the bacon, it overflowed the pot";
